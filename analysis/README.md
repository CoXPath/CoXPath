# Python scripts to compare / create / find patterns among networkx objects and jupyter notebooks implementing these methods to conduct a large scale analysis

## helper functions scripts
- *create_interactome.ipynb*: create and put together the interactome
- *network_utils.py*: functions to analyze networkx objects
- *ora.py*: functions to run Over Representation Analysis (ORA)


## jupyter notebook implementations
- *3.1_analysis.ipynb*: implementation using the helper functions to get an overview of disease-specific co-expression networks
- *3.2.1_analysis.ipynb*: implementation using the helper functions to explore the most and least common proteins of the co-expression networks
- *3.2.2_analysis.ipynb*: implementation using the helper functions to do a meta-analysis on consistently differentially expressed genes across diseases
- *3.3_analysis.ipynb*: implementation using the helper functions to investigate global trends of disease-specific co-expression networks at the edge level
- *3.4_analysis.ipynb*: implementation using the helper functions to overlay co-expression networks with pathway knowledge and identify disease associated pathways
- *3.5_analysis.ipynb*: implementation using the helper functions to conduct a case scenario of an in-depth investigation of the long term potentiation pathway in the context of schizophrenia
